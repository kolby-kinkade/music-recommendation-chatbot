In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become integral to everyday life, impacting not only scientists but also the general public. The widespread adoption of AI technologies has led to the development of various applications, including advanced AI chatbots. These chatbots utilize sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enabling them to respond in real-time to a diverse array of questions across multiple disciplines. Additionally, rule-based chatbots, another form of AI, operate by following predefined sets of rules. This allows users to engage in conversations or ask questions about specific topics, such as the weather, customer service inquiries, or frequently asked questions (FAQs). This project focuses on developing a rule-based chatbot specifically designed for music recommendations. Music is a universal language that people across the globe enjoy for various reasons, such as seeking inspiration, finding comfort, or indulging in nostalgia. However, individuals often face the dilemma of not knowing what they are in the mood to listen to or wanting to discover new music. The chatbot developed in this project aims to address this challenge by bridging the gap between technology and people's love for music. Leveraging the capabilities of NLP and regular expressions, this chatbot uses the underlying logic of rule-based chatbots to interact with users. It poses a series of carefully crafted questions tailored to gather information about the users' musical preferences, such as their choice between albums and songs, preferred genres, and favored decades of music. Based on the responses, the chatbot provides personalized music recommendations, enhancing the user's listening experience and helping them explore new musical landscapes. By combining AI technology with the universal appeal of music, this project demonstrates the potential of rule-based chatbots in creating meaningful and enjoyable interactions.
